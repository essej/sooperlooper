	The engine can be controlled with MIDI via the
	ALSA sequencer interface on Linux and CoreMidi on OS X.

	  <p>
	    To connect your MIDI device to SooperLooper, you first need to use a MIDI patchbay such as
	    the one found <a href="http://notahat.com/midi_patchbay">here</a>.  This only applies to the "standalone" application, the AudioUnit
	    gets its midi events directly from the host.
	  </p>
	</div>
	
	<p>
	  Do learn-style control binding by choosing the learn option from the 
	context menu's of a button, slider or control.
	  Control-Middle-clicking on the button or
	  slider is a shortcut to start learning.
	</p>

	You can edit, load, and save the midi
	bindings through the MIDI Bindings window in the
	GUI.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  The main area of the MIDI Bindings window contains a list
	  showing the currently bound commands and controls.  Below
	  the list are controls which reflect the currently selected
	  item,  allowing for modification of the selected binding,
	  or the addition of a new binding.
	  </p>
	<p>
	  The Command/Control area
	  allows for picking the specific command (record, overdub,
	  etc) or one of the available numeric or togglable controls
	  (feedback, output level, sync, etc), and which loop index
	  the binding will control.  The SUS option makes the binding
	  behave as a momentary control with note and CC events (see
	  <a href="doc_midi_commands.html">MIDI commands</a>).  The All choice will apply
	  the command to all loop instances, the Selected will apply it to
	currently selected loop instance (changed via GUI keyboard controls 0-9 or
	the global controls selected_loop_num, select_prev_loop, select_next_loop, and select_all_loops
	which can be bound to midi events themselves).
	</p>

	<p> The MIDI Event area allows editing of the midi event
	  parameters for a binding.     The Range entries become active with
	  controls to specify how the midi 0-127 values are mapped to
	  the target control.  The scaling type choice may be either
	  Normal (linear) or Gain (logarithmic).  The first entry maps
	  to midi value of 0, the second entry maps to 127.  For instance, on the gain and level
	  controls, the native range of the control is from 0 -> 1, so a midi event with 127 value will
	  set the control to 1, and 0 for 0.  If you wanted to ignore the lower end of the range, you could
	  set the min to 0.5, and then an event with 0 value will set the value to that.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If the Learn button is pressed,
	  the next incoming midi event will set the controls to its
	  value.  <b>Note that no binding is changed until
	  Add New or Modify is pressed which adds a new binding or modifies
	  the existing selected one respectively.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  You
	  can also load the intial bindings from the saved bindings file with the
	  <b>-m</b> option (to the engine) or by specifying in the GUI's Looper Connection window.  Example binding files are to be found
	  installed in PREFIX/share/sooperlooper/presets/ directory with the extension
	'.slb'.

The feature-set is closely based on that of the EDP (LoopIII and many features from LoopIV)
 so reading the
	   <a
	      href="http://www.loopers-delight.com/tools/echoplex/echoplex.html">EDP Manuals</a> can be useful.

	<p>
	  Certain aspects are obviously different, especially in the
	  area of synchronization, which is still under
	  development.  More complete documentation will follow later.
	</p>
	<p>
	  SooperLooper allows you to have any number
	  (limited by available RAM) of loops running
	  simultaneously, and each loop can have an
	  arbitrary number of channels.  Each channel of
	  each loop will have an input and output port
	  available for connection under JACK.
	</p>
	<h4>Command Options</h4>
	<p> SooperLooper supports long-presses (from gui, or when commands
	  are bound from MIDI note message).  When a command is held down for more than 2 seconds,
	  it becomes a momentary (or SUS) control, so that when the command is released, it ends the
	  operation (as if you had quickly pressed and released a command twice).  In the gui, middle-mouse button
	  press-releases are always momentary (releases always end the operation immediately).  
	  MIDI bindings have a SUS option, that if set will treat that binding as an immediate
	  momentary operation (SUS).
	  </p>


	<h4> Command Reference </h4>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>RECORD</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Start here.  If the record threshold is all the way down,
	  pressing it once will start recording and pressing
	  again will end the recording.
	  <p>
	    
	    If the Threshold is set higher the loop recording doesn't start until
	    the audio data is greater than the threshold.  When finishing the loop, the threshold value is ignored. 
	    
	    See the tips in the EDP manual, it works best if you
	    stop and start recording the moment you hit the downbeat, not
	    before.  Trust them.
	  <p>
	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    <ul>
	    <li>If you end a RECORD with another function (OVERDUB, MULTIPLY, REPLACE, SUBSTITUTE, INSERT, ONCE) it will finish the loop
	    immediately (threshold ignored) and start doing the new function.

	    <li>
	    Ending with REVERSE stops recording and plays the
	    loop backwards once then goes into MUTE mode.
		</ul>
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>OVERDUB</b>
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox">
	  This keeps playing the loop and adds whatever you
	  play on top until you stop overdubbing.  Very useful.... this is the main
	  tool.  The Feedback controls the amount of the original loop that
	  is used every pass.  In actuality, when
	  Feedback is set to 100%, it uses a
	  slightly less amount to help prevent clipping on output.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>MULTIPLY</b>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox">
	  This similar to overdub, except the original loop is repeated
	  underneath you "multiplying" the loop length until you stop it.
	  Thus it can turn a 1 measure loop into a 2,3, etc measure loop.
	  QuantizeMode and RoundMode affect how the overdubbing starts and
	  stops, see the EDP manual for more details.  Keep in mind that the original
	  loop length is a "cycle" and the loop length will be a multiple of
	  that.  You can actually make an already multiplied loop have fewer
	  cycles with the right combination of options.

	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    <ul>
	      <li> If you end a MULTIPLY with a RECORD press it ends the loop
	    immediately and resets the cycle length to the whole loop.
	      <li> The MultiIncrease function is implemented which allows you to 
		increment the cycle count ahead of time, without needing to wait 
		until the exact time to finish the multiply.  See the EDP LoopIV
		documentation for more info.  Basically, press Multiply as if you 
                were finishing it, then before the current cycle plays out, press Multiply again 
                repeatedly to add cycles. The multiply will resume and automatically go into 
                playback after the specified number of cycles.
	    </ul>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>INSERT</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  It inserts new input in place, but always one "cycle" length...
	  QuantizeMode and RoundMode have effects (refer to EDP Manual).  

	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    Ending with a RECORD press it ends the operation
	    immediately and resets the cycle length to the whole loop.
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REPLACE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Replaces the audio in the loop for the duration of the command.  The existing loop audio is not
	  heard during the operation.
	  <p>
	    When Quantize mode is set, this operation will be quantized on start and finish.
	</div>
	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>SUBSTITUTE</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Is like Replace except you still hear the current underlying loop audio 
	  as it records new audio into the loop.  On the next time around, only the 
	  newly recorded audio will be heard.  This helps maintain the groove 
	  when recording a replacement section, because you can play with what was there.
	  <p>
	  When Quantize mode is set, this operation will be quantized on start and finish.	  
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REVERSE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">

	  Reverses playback direction.  Can be used in play mode, and even
	  during an OVERDUB, which makes for some pretty interesting stuff.
	  Can also be used in DELAY mode.  If Quantize is on, the reversal 
	  doesn't happen until the next sync boundary, thus keeping the
	  loop in time.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>UNDO</b>
	  </div>
	
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Restores the playing loop to the state before the last operation.
	  It maintains the current time position if the current loop was based
	  on the previous loop (eg, not newly recorded).  You can go all the way back to
	  the first one still intact within the loop memory.  As more operations are done, more of
	  the available loop memory is used, and it will eventually start reclaiming the oldest versions.
	</div>
	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REDO</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Redoes the loop if it can (if you haven't done a new operation since
	  your last undo).  Taken together UNDO and REDO allow you to do some
	  neat things: record a verse part, then hit record to do a chorus
	  part.  To get back to the verse, press UNDO... to get to the chorus
	  press REDO...  Pressing UNDO while in MUTE mode undoes all the way
	  back (can be redone).
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>MUTE MODE</b>
	</div>
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Press to mute loop output.  Dry passthough audio will be unaffected.
	  To continue playing the loop in time press MUTE again.  To continue playing
	  the loop from the top press TRIG.  To play back the loop once and
	  return to mute, press ONCE.
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>TRIGGER</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  this immediately restarts the loop
	  playing back from the beginning.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>ONCE</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  this immediately restarts the loop
	  playing back from the beginning, and goes into
	  MUTE mode at the end of the loop.
	</div>	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>LOAD/SAVE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  These commands allow you to load a loop from an audio file.
	  The file becomes a new loop, so it must be
	  shorter than the available loop time, or the
	  operation will fail.  Many audio file formats are supported, but the sample rate should
	  match that of the current loop, as no resampling is currently done on load.

	  <p>
	  Save will save the
	  current loop to an 32bit float WAV file.  The loop playback is not
	  interrupted when saving.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b> DELAY MODE</b>
	  </div>
	
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Pressing the Delay control triggers Delay Mode. The time between the
	  most recent two presses is the new delay time.  While in DELAY mode,
	  you can toggle Hold Mode (by pressing Replace), or Reverse at any time for a cool effect.
	  To get out of delay mode press any other function or UNDO.  You will
	  probably want to adjust Feedback down from 1 before you enter delay
	  mode or you'll build up a nice cacophony fast.
	</div>

	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>Rate Adjustment</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The rate can be adjusted anytime (even during Recording) and will affect both the
	  underlying loop and any new incoming audio recorded onto the loop, reminiscent of 
	  tape delay systems.  Altering the Rate during recording/overdubbing, etc can result 
	  in interesting recorded audio.  The GUI has buttons for easy access to 1/2 speed, double speed, and 
	  normal (1x) speed.   MIDI bindings can be created to act like these buttons by specifying the range 
          min and max to equal the target rate.
	  </div>


	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>SCRATCH MODE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  By default the Scratch Rate Active is toggled off which means it
	  ignores the Scratch Rate parameter.  Changes in the Scratch Position
	  parameter over time define the rate of playback (position unit
	  is ratio of current loop length).  The implementation is still pretty rough sounding.
	  <p>
	    I've personally used a
	    theremin
	    (the <a href="http://www.paia.com">PAIA</a> Theremax) with CV output through
	    my MIDI pedal, although the scratching code needs some work.

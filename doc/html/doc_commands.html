      <div id="Content">




The feature-set is roughly based on that of the EDP (LoopIII and many features from LoopIV)
 so reading the
	   <a
	      href="http://www.loopers-delight.com/tools/echoplex/echoplex.html">EDP Manuals</a> can be useful.

	<p>
	  SooperLooper allows you to have any number
	  (limited by available RAM) of loops running
	  simultaneously, and each loop can have an
	  arbitrary number of channels.  Each channel of
	  each loop will have an input and output port
	  available for connection under JACK.
	</p>
	<h4>Command Options</h4>
	<p> SooperLooper supports long-presses (from gui, or when commands
	  are bound from MIDI note message).  When a command is held down for more than 1 second,
	  it becomes a momentary (or SUS) control, so that when the command is released, it ends the
	  operation (as if you had quickly pressed and released a command twice).  In the gui, middle-mouse button
	  press-releases are always momentary (releases always end the operation immediately).  
	  MIDI bindings have a SUS option, that if set will treat that binding as an immediate
	  momentary operation (SUS).
	  </p>


	<h4> Command Reference </h4>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>RECORD</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Start here.  If the record threshold is all the way down,
	  pressing it once will start recording and pressing
	  again will end the recording.
	  <p>
	    
	    If the Threshold is set higher the loop recording doesn't start until
	    the audio data is greater than the threshold.  When finishing the loop, the threshold value is ignored. 
	    
	    See the tips in the EDP manual, it works best if you
	    stop and start recording the moment you hit the downbeat, not
	    before.  Trust them.
	  <p>
	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    <ul>
	    <li>If you end a RECORD with another function (OVERDUB, MULTIPLY, REPLACE, SUBSTITUTE, INSERT, ONCE) it will finish the loop
	    immediately (threshold ignored) and start doing the new function.

	    <li>
	    Ending with REVERSE stops recording and plays the
	    loop backwards once then goes into MUTE mode.
		</ul>
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>OVERDUB</b>
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox">
	  This keeps playing the loop and adds whatever you
	  play on top until you stop overdubbing.  Very useful.... this is the main
	  tool.  The Feedback controls the amount of the original loop that
	  is used every pass.  In actuality, when
	  Feedback is set to 100%, it uses a
	  slightly less amount to help prevent clipping on output.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>MULTIPLY</b>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox">
	  This similar to overdub, except the original loop is
	  repeated underneath you "multiplying" the loop length until
	  you stop it.  Thus it can turn a 1 measure loop into a 2,3,
	  etc measure loop.  QuantizeMode and RoundMode affect how the
	  overdubbing starts and stops.  QuantizeMode affects when the
	  operation begins, and RoundMode affects if the new audio
	  continues to be added throughthe end of the current cycle
	  after hitting the final record.
	  <p>
	  Keep in mind that the
	  original loop length is a "cycle" and the loop length will
	  be a multiple of that.  You can actually make an already
	  multiplied loop have fewer cycles when using Multiply on
	  loops that have already been multiplied.

	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    <ul>
	      <li> If you end a MULTIPLY with a RECORD press it ends the loop
	    immediately and resets the cycle length to the whole loop.
	      <li> The MultiIncrease function is implemented which allows you to 
		increment the cycle count ahead of time, without needing to wait 
		until the exact time to finish the multiply.  
		 Basically, press Multiply as if you 
                were finishing it, then before the current cycle plays out, press Multiply again 
                repeatedly to add cycles. The multiply will resume and automatically go into 
                playback after the specified number of cycles.
	    </ul>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>INSERT</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  It inserts new input in place, but always one "cycle" length...
	  QuantizeMode and RoundMode have effects similar to Multiply.  

	  <div class="ending_box">
	    <b>Special Endings</b> <br>
	    Ending with a RECORD press it ends the operation
	    immediately and resets the cycle length to the whole loop.
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REPLACE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Replaces the audio in the loop for the duration of the command.  The existing loop audio is not
	  heard during the operation.
	  <p>
	    When Quantize mode is set, this operation will be
	    quantized on start and finish with the current sync and
	    quantize parameters.
	</div>
	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>SUBSTITUTE</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Is like Replace except you still hear the current underlying loop audio 
	  as it records new audio into the loop.  On the next time around, only the 
	  newly recorded audio will be heard.  This helps maintain the groove 
	  when recording a replacement section, because you can play with what was there.
	  <p>
	  When Quantize mode is set, this operation will be quantized on start and finish.	  
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REVERSE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">

	  Reverses playback direction.  Can be used in play mode, and even
	  during an OVERDUB, which makes for some pretty interesting stuff.
	  Can also be used in DELAY mode.  If Quantize is on, the reversal 
	  doesn't happen until the next sync boundary, thus keeping the
	  loop in time.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>UNDO</b>
	  </div>
	
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Restores the playing loop to the state before the last operation.
	  It maintains the current time position if the current loop was based
	  on the previous loop (eg, not newly recorded).  You can go all the way back to
	  the first one still intact within the loop memory.  As more operations are done, more of
	  the available loop memory is used, and it will eventually
	  start reclaiming the oldest versions.

	  <p> Note that to undo all existing state, do a long-press of Undo.

	  <p> Pressing Undo when an operation is waiting for sync or quantization will
	    cancel the pending operation.
	    
	</div>
	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>REDO</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  Redoes the loop if it can (if you haven't done a new operation since
	  your last undo).  Taken together UNDO and REDO allow you to do some
	  neat things: record a verse part, then hit record to do a chorus
	  part.  To get back to the verse, press UNDO... to get to the chorus
	  press REDO.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>MUTE</b>
	</div>
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Press to mute loop output.  Dry passthough audio will be unaffected.
	  To continue playing the loop in time press MUTE again.  To continue playing
	  the loop from the top press TRIG.  To play back the loop once and
	  return to mute, press ONCE.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>TRIGGER</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  this immediately restarts the loop
	  playing back from the beginning.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>ONCE</b>
	  </div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  this immediately restarts the loop
	  playing back from the beginning, and goes into
	  MUTE mode at the end of the loop.
	</div>	

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>PAUSE</b>
	</div>
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Press to pause loop playback.  Dry passthough audio will be unaffected.
	  To continue playing the loop from the paused time press PAUSE again.  To continue playing
	  the loop from the top press TRIG.  To play back the loop once and
	  return to mute, press ONCE.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>SOLO</b>
	</div>
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Pressing SOLO will mute all other looper instances.  Pressing it again will revert to the previous
	  state before solo was pressed (eg, loops that were muted before the first press will stay muted).  Pressing solo for
	  a different loop will cause that loop to be the new soloed loop, only one loop may be soloed currently.

	</div>


	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>LOAD/SAVE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  These commands allow you to load a loop from an audio file.
	  The file becomes a new loop, so it must be
	  shorter than the available loop time, or the
	  operation will fail.  Many audio file formats are supported, but the sample rate should
	  match that of the current loop, as no resampling is currently done on load.

	  <p>
	  Save will save the
	  current loop to an 32bit float WAV file.  The loop playback is not
	  interrupted when saving.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b> DELAY MODE</b>
	  </div>
	
  	<div class="commandbox">
	  Pressing the Delay control triggers Delay Mode. The time between the
	  most recent two presses is the new delay time.  While in DELAY mode,
	  you can toggle Hold Mode (by pressing Replace), or Reverse at any time for a cool effect.
	  To get out of delay mode press any other function or UNDO.  You will
	  probably want to adjust Feedback down from 1 before you enter delay
	  mode or you'll build up a nice cacophony fast.
	</div>

	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>Rate Adjustment</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The rate can be adjusted anytime (even during Recording) and will affect both the
	  underlying loop and any new incoming audio recorded onto the loop, reminiscent of 
	  tape delay systems.  Altering the Rate during recording/overdubbing, etc can result 
	  in interesting recorded audio.  The GUI has buttons for easy access to 1/2 speed, double speed, and 
	  normal (1x) speed.   MIDI bindings can be created to act like these buttons by specifying the range 
          min and max to equal the target rate.
	  </div>


	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>SCRATCH MODE</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  By default the Scratch Rate Active is toggled off which means it
	  ignores the Scratch Rate parameter.  Changes in the Scratch Position
	  parameter over time define the rate of playback (position unit
	  is ratio of current loop length).  The implementation is still pretty rough sounding.
	  <p>
	    I've personally used a
	    theremin
	    (the <a href="http://www.paia.com">PAIA</a> Theremax) with CV output through
	    my MIDI pedal, although the scratching code needs some work.
	</div>


	<h4> Control Reference </h4>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>main in mon</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>main in mon</b> control sets the level of any incoming
	  audio for passthrough monitoring to the common outputs.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>main out</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>main wet</b> control sets master level of all loop
	  audio being sent out the main output ports.  It does not
	  affect the passthrough level from the main inputs, use the
	  main in mon control for that.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>input gain</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>input gain</b> control sets a gain attenuation of the incoming
	  main input audio.  This affect the input into the loops only, not the main
	  passthrough monitoring.
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>xfade</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>xfade</b> control sets the length in samples that
	  is used to crossfade the audio on loop
	  operations.   Useful to prevent unwanted clicks caused by
	  waveform discontinuities.  However, if you want them set
	  this value to 0.  The control in the GUI affects all loops.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>pan</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>pan</b> controls sets the panning for a given channel
	  in a loop to the common outputs.  Note that the panning does
	  not affect the discrete output ports for each loop, it only
	  pans the signal to the stereo common outputs.  A mono loop
	  will have a single panner, and stereo and multichannel loops
	  will have one stereo panner for each channel to allow full
	  control of signal width and panning.  
	</div>
	
	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>main in</b>
	</div>
	<div class="commandbox">
	  The <b>main in</b> control toggles the use of the main
	  inputs for audio input to the loop.  This option only shows up with the loop
	  also has discrete inputs.
	</div>

	<div class="commandbox_head">
	  <b>Please see the documentation on <a href="doc_sync.html">Sync</a> for a description of other
	  important controls. </b>

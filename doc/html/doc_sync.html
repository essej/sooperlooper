	  SooperLooper can quantize most operations with a choice of
	  several sources and parameters.  When enabled, the quantize
	  operations affect all loops.
	</p>

	<center><img src="sync_controls.png"></center>

	<p>
	  The <b>sync to</b> control
	  chooses what source to use for synchronization: None,
	  Internal Tempo, MIDI clock, JACK transport, or any of the
	  existing loops.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The <b>tempo</b> control shows the current tempo,
	  and is only editable directly when <b>sync to</b> is set to
	  None or Internal.   When MIDI clock is selected, the tempo
	  will be updated to reflect the estimated tempo based on any
	  incoming MIDI clock ticks.  When JACK transport is selected,
	  it will always reflect the tempo specified by the current
	  JACK time master (if any).  However, when one of the loops
	  is selected as the sync source, the tempo is defined
	  entirely by the current loop's length and the
	  <b>8th/cycle</b> parameter.

	</p>

	<p> The <b>tap</b> button lets you tap in a tempo when in
	  Internal (or None) sync-to mode.  This function can also be
	  done with a keybinding ('t' by default) and a MIDI binding.
	  The tap button also pulses with the current tempo giving a
	  visual indication of it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The <b>8th/cycle</b> parameter defines how many 8th notes as
	  defined by the current tempo (there are 2 eighths per beat)
	  are in a cycle of a current loop, or a potential loop.  As
	  described below, the cycle length is useful as a
	  quantization boundary, as well as an eighth-note itself.

	</p>
	<p>
	  The <b>quantize</b> parameter defines when
	operations sync to in reference to the sync source.  The
	available choices are Off, Cycle, 8th, and Loop.  Note that no
	sync will ever occur if this value is set to Off.
	When the sync source is another loop, the choices are all
	valid.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  The <b>rel sync</b> parameter specifies a special
	mode of sync when recording new loops similar to the EDP's unquantized SyncRecord function.
	  When used in conjunction with a sync 
source, a quantize setting other than off, and a loop's "sync" 
option, will allow you to start recording a new loop at any time 
and it will keep track of the sync and round off the loop so the 
length is a multiple of the sync interval.  In other words this 
allows you to be synced to another loop, midi, etc but start 
recording exactly when you want (instead of it waiting until the 
next sync point) and still get the right length loop.  
	</p>

	
	<div class="flowimage" >
	  <img src="sync_checks.png">
	</div>

	<p>
	  If the <b>sync</b> option is checked for a
	  particular loop, operations will be quantized to the
	  selected boundary.  This includes Record,  Multiply,
	  Replace, Substitute, Insert, Reverse, Trigger, and Once.
	  Note that Overdub is never quantized.  When a command is
	  performed, the actual operation won't start/stop until the
	  precise moment of the next sync boundary arrives.  For
	  instance, when the sync source is a loop, and the quantize
	  parameter is Cycle, a Record operation will start and stop
	  on an exact cycle boundary of the source loop.  More
	  interesting polyrhythms are possible when using 8ths as the
	  quantize parameter, for example.

	</p>

	<p>
	  The <b>play sync</b> option for a loop causes the
	  playback of the loop to be coerced to remain in sync with
	  the selected syncto source.  Currently, this is done by
	  retriggering the loop if an external sync boundary occurs
	  when near a loop boundary (+/- the current quantize type).
	  This technique is particulary suitable for maintaining playback sync
	  with MIDI clock which may drift with respect to the audio
	  playback.  Note that it does <b>not</b> currently do any
	  timestretching or rate resampling, so it isn't suitable for
	  dealing with external tempo changes from the original recorded loop's
	  tempo.

      <h4> Latency Compensation </h4>
<p>
  Latency compensation allows those of you who
don't monitor your live input through software have SL put your
overdubs in the right place, irregardless of your buffer size.  Please
note that if you are currently playing software instruments or using
SW effects inline for monitoring, then you probably won't use the
compensation feature because you are hearing what you get when you
play with the loop, and you're only real choice is to use small buffer
sizes to get low latency.  This might not be strictly true with regard
to initial loop record/playback and triggering, we'll see.
</p>
  <p>
In the GUI you will see a new tab in the Preferences window called
Latency.  This exposes controls for Input Latency and Output Latency,
as well as a toggle to automatically pick the values for these based
on the information gathered from JACK or the AU plugin host.  Note the
numbers from JACK are more likely to be correct, as AU plugins don't
get all the info they need to judge it.  Either way, the automatic
will only get you close, you might need to tweak the values yourself
based on your hardware setup as well.  Basically, both controls
together affect the compensation of overdubs, but the Input Latency
also affects what content gets added to loop.  If it is too low, you
can actually get audio the was played before you started the
operation, and if too high you will cut off audio you intended to get
recorded.  Once the Input latency feels right, if the overdubs aren't
aligned with the existing loop audio the way you heard it when
playing, then adjust the Output Latency.  There is an excellent
description of this in Mobius' documentation in the
<a href="http://zonemobius.com/mobiusdoc.htm#Latency%20Calibration">latency calibration</a> section.
Check out the last 3 paragraphs of that section especially.
</p>
  <p>
The Latency tab also has a "Automatically Disable Compensation when
Monitoring input" option, which when enabled automatically turns off
any compensation when your 'main in mon' control is not -infinity.
This enforces the fact that if you are passing the input through for
monitoring in SW you are hearing andn playing to the latency already.
However, you may still want some input
compensation to get the intended content in the loop based on your
triggering of the operation.
